# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to documenting the **requirement analysis** phase of a booking management system project.  

The purpose is to practice and master how requirements are gathered, structured, and documented in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.  
It will cover:  
- Identifying functional and non-functional requirements  
- Creating visual diagrams (use case, actors, etc.)  
- Defining acceptance criteria  
- Following industry-standard practices for requirement analysis

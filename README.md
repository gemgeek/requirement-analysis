# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to documenting the **requirement analysis** phase of a booking management system project.  

The purpose is to practice and master how requirements are gathered, structured, and documented in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.  
It will cover:  
- Identifying functional and non-functional requirements  
- Creating visual diagrams (use case, actors, etc.)  
- Defining acceptance criteria  
- Following industry-standard practices for requirement analysis

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of **gathering, understanding, and documenting** the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  
It serves as the foundation of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it clearly defines *what* needs to be built before actual development begins.

Key points about Requirement Analysis:
- **Clarifies scope:** Prevents misunderstandings by ensuring all stakeholders agree on the goals.  
- **Guides development:** Provides developers, designers, and testers with a structured roadmap.  
- **Saves time and cost:** Detecting issues in the requirement phase is far cheaper than fixing them later.  
- **Improves quality:** Leads to systems that better meet user needs and business objectives.  

In short, requirement analysis is critical because it ensures that the final system is both **useful** (solves the right problem) and **usable** (works effectively for end users).

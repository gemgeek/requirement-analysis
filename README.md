# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to documenting the **requirement analysis** phase of a booking management system project.  

The purpose is to practice and master how requirements are gathered, structured, and documented in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.  
It will cover:  
- Identifying functional and non-functional requirements  
- Creating visual diagrams (use case, actors, etc.)  
- Defining acceptance criteria  
- Following industry-standard practices for requirement analysis

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of **gathering, understanding, and documenting** the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  
It serves as the foundation of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it clearly defines *what* needs to be built before actual development begins.

Key points about Requirement Analysis:
- **Clarifies scope:** Prevents misunderstandings by ensuring all stakeholders agree on the goals.  
- **Guides development:** Provides developers, designers, and testers with a structured roadmap.  
- **Saves time and cost:** Detecting issues in the requirement phase is far cheaper than fixing them later.  
- **Improves quality:** Leads to systems that better meet user needs and business objectives.  

In short, requirement analysis is critical because it ensures that the final system is both **useful** (solves the right problem) and **usable** (works effectively for end users).


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a **cornerstone of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it directly impacts the success or failure of a project. Some key reasons include:

1. **Prevents Miscommunication**  
   Clearly documenting requirements ensures that all stakeholders, developers, designers, testers, and clients share the same understanding of the systemâ€™s goals.

2. **Reduces Costs and Delays**  
   Identifying problems or unclear requirements early is far less expensive than fixing them later in the development or deployment stages.

3. **Ensures User Satisfaction**  
   By focusing on actual business needs and user expectations, requirement analysis increases the likelihood that the final product will solve the right problem and provide real value.

4. **Provides a Roadmap for Development**  
   Well-defined requirements act as a guide for the team, reducing confusion and keeping the project aligned with its objectives.


## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities that ensure project requirements are captured, understood, and validated properly:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting initial inputs from stakeholders, clients, and users to identify high-level needs.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Using techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation to uncover detailed requirements.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Organizing and recording requirements clearly in documents, diagrams, or models for easy reference by the team.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Examining the requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness, often representing them visually through use cases, flowcharts, or diagrams.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Confirming with stakeholders that the documented requirements accurately reflect their needs and expectations.
